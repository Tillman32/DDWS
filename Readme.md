# DDWS - Data-driven Web Service
Rapidly build prototype concepts, and seamlessly request your data with this intelligent web service.  

## Installation

1) Open a terminal/cmd window, navigate to the application root and run: `npm install`
2) Run the server: `node server.js`

## Usage

Simply add your JSON data to the `data` directory within the application and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api/<JSONFileName>`

> Note the JSON file name does not need the .json extension.

## Examples
Given the following JSON data file "exampledata.json" in the data directory:
```JSON
[{
      "id": 1,
      "gender": "Male",
      "first_name": "George",
      "last_name": "Murray",
      "email": "gmurray0@symantec.com",
      "ip_address": "200.50.2.50"
    }, {
      "id": 2,
      "gender": "Female",
      "first_name": "Dorothy",
      "last_name": "Greene",
      "email": "dgreene1@addtoany.com",
      "ip_address": "97.68.210.247"
    }, {
      "id": 3,
      "gender": "Female",
      "first_name": "Lisa",
      "last_name": "Johnson",
      "email": "ljohnson2@mit.edu",
      "ip_address": "196.53.51.225"
}]
```
I'm able to tell the service how I want to filter this data via RESTFUL calls to the service. For example, if I wanted to select an object, whose key is `id` and value is `2`:

`http://localhost:8080/api/exampledata/id/2`

This would return the single object, who's id is 2:
```JSON
{
  "id": 2,
  "gender": "Female",
  "first_name": "Dorothy",
  "last_name": "Greene",
  "email": "dgreene1@addtoany.com",
  "ip_address": "97.68.210.247"
}
```
