For example, if I wanted to select an object, whose key is `id` and value is `2`:\r\n\r\n`http://localhost:8080/api/exampledata/id/2`\r\n\r\nThis would return the single object, who's id is 2:\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 2,\r\n  \"gender\": \"Female\",\r\n  \"first_name\": \"Dorothy\",\r\n  \"last_name\": \"Greene\",\r\n  \"email\": \"dgreene1@addtoany.com\",\r\n  \"ip_address\": \"97.68.210.247\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
